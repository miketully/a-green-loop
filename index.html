  <p class="title">A GREEN LOOP</p>
  <p>A GREEN LOOP is a 33-minute guided sound walk exploring the gaps in symbolic representation in graphic design, the distance between memories and the present, and the ephemeral around sculptural permanence. The walk loops between the steps of Green Hall to the New Haven Green and back again.

  <p>Please start at the top of the front steps outside of Green Hall and begin playing the audio. The sound will guide you on A GREEN LOOP. If you are using your phone, you can turn it on do not disturb mode and then put your phone in your pocket to avoid distractions. The audio can be accessed via the cassette and walkman tape player available to borrow or through the link below.</p>
