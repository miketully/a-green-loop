  <p class="script">(Intro)</p>
  <p>Hello. Maybe you know this voice, have heard it recently, not so recently, or haven't ever heard it all before. I'll be guiding you on our walk today. Take a second to be present, look around you, look at Chapel street from these steps.</p>
  
  <p>It sounds like someone is practicing their vocal exercises upstairs.</p> 
  
  <p>Alright, let’s keep moving.</p> 
  
  <p class="script">(At the beginning of the walk)</p>
  <p>“Quality, light, color, depth, which are there before us, are there only because they awaken an echo in our bodies and because the body welcomes them.” Merlau-Ponty wrote that. What is echoing within you? Let’s bring that with us today.</p> 
  
  
  <p class="script">(Moving down 1156 Chapel steps along short wall on right)</p>
  <p>Stepping down the steps and to our right walk along the wall and stop at the telephone poll at the left. Look at the wall engraving here. Do you see the word "Green"? There is a time of day, maybe time of year, that when the sunlight hits the building across the street just right, it casts a greenish reflection of light right on the word “Green” carved into the stone here.</p>
  
  
  <p class="script">(At the “Green” engraving outside 1156 Chapel St)</p>
  <p>Run your fingers along the engraving. What does “green” feel like? What do you imagine when you’re touching a color?</p>
  
  <p>Our friend Merlau-Ponty declared, “Color is the "place where our brain and the universe meet … All flesh, and even that of the world, radiates beyond itself.” “The eye is an instrument that moves itself, a means which invents its own ends; it is that which has been moved by some impact of the world, which it then restores to the visible through the traces of a hand.”</p> 
  
  
  <p class="script">(walking from Chapel and York to “Details” alley)</p>
  <p>“sea of rectangular tiles on way to details sign”</p> 
  
  
  <p class="script">(sitting at the “Details” sign in the alley)</p>
  <p>The word ‘details’ jumps out of the street theater at us. The sign, on the back, is like a blank canvas waiting to be painted on. It allows us to draw the details from our own experiences onto it. What do you see here? What traces would you leave for someone else?</p>
  
  
  <p class="script">(Walking into the New Haven Green)</p>
  <p>As you see the grass beneath your feet on your walk through the New Haven Green something interesting comes to mind which is the memories of things that have happened here and the past. The interesting thing about memories is that despite whatever weather you might be feeling outside today the weather of that memory might still be intact and in fact survive the weather of whatever comes after it so so whether you see grass leaves snow covering those up or even if it's a hotter day today than it was when I recorded this the sounds from those of past memories still live on.</p>
  
  <p>The crunching of the leaves beneath our feet might be a crunching of snow underneath yours or the crunchiness of sticks and bramble.</p> 
  
  <p>Similar to memories, my voice is both kind of here and not here on this walk with you. A trace of me, rather than all of me.</p>
  
  
  <p class="script">(After looking at monument)</p>
  <p>Alright, let's move towards the corner of the park, just over there where the street is. When we get to the corner let’s stop and look west down Chapel street, towards the direction we came from. The bus stop is always so full of life isn’t it. Kind of like ordinary monuments, each person is coming and going, with their journey ahead of or behind them. But for a brief moment, here they are, at the stop. Even that word “stop” makes me think of sculptures or monuments, the way they are rendered into one moment for all time. The philosopher Merlau-Ponty once wrote, “the world is made of the very stuff of the body.” describing this kind of process—bodies making bodies, or perhaps something more abstract, but like my professor Sondra has said, “the body is never far away.”</p>
  
  <p>Do you remember a song that teachers used to sing when we were young, "the wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round". "Round and round" trails off...</p>
  
  
  <p class="script">(On the walk to Nevelson Sculpture, passing parking meter sign)</p>
  <p>There is somehow always a distance between a thing and a representation of a thing, the gap between sign and thing. This distance is like a proposition for perception of what is and what might be.</p>
